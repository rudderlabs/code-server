## 💡 Quick heads up

**About permissions:** The copilot may ask for clipboard access to help you copy code, configs, or commands easily. And it uses an MCP server that might ask you to approve tool calls. Just approve when prompted - it's all secure and needed for the copilot to work properly.

**How to work with the copilot:**

- Chat naturally - no need to be formal
- Be specific about your data (table names, column names help)
- Where-ever possible, be specific about the feature definitions
- Ask follow-up questions if something's unclear
- You can ideate on what features are relevant for your end-goal, what to predict using the profiles ML models etc. Having access to your warehoue data, this makes copilot quite contextual and powerful in answering tehse.

**It's interactive:** The copilot will ask YOU questions too - about your warehouse, tables, what you're trying to build. That's how it figures out the best setup for your use case.

## 🎓 New to Profiles?

Don't worry! The copilot can explain concepts as you go, but here's the TL;DR:

**RudderStack Profiles** lets you build unified customer profiles directly in your data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.).

You'll work with YAML files to configure:

- **inputs.yaml** - Where your data lives (tables, schemas)
- **models.yaml** - How to stitch IDs and define features
- **pb_project.yaml** - Overall project config

The copilot will guide you through all of this step by step.
